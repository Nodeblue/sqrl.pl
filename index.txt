SQRL - Secure QR Login

Pronounced "squirrel"

An Illustrated Guide


An easy-to-use, high security replacement for usernames and passwords.


How does SQRL work?

  <image: computer with login and QR>
  When you visit a website that supports SQRL you will be presented with a QR code to login with.
  
  <image: computer and phone showing QR>
  Using your SQRL app take a picture of the QR code.
  
  <image: confirm url and checkbox on phone>
  The SQRL app will confirm the website you are attempting to login and that you want to authenticate to the website.
  
  <image: welcome displayed on computer>
  Depending on how the website operates you may need to click login or it may automatically do it for you. Now you are authenticated without needing to type a thing!

  However if you are logging in to a phone, tablet or computer directly you will be able to tap or click the QR code for your SQRL app to authenticate you. Depending on the app it may be able to verify the site automatically.


- Simple, secure. -


What's going on behind the scenes?
  
  <image: phone with cogs pointing to SQRL ID card>
  The first time you use SQRL, you will be required to invent a master password, from which a SQRL ID is cryptographically generated. This ID is a 256-bit (very very large) random number, unique and never shared.

  Additionally the first time using SQRL an Identity Lock (public) and an Identity Unlock (private) Key pair are generated. The Identity Unlock Key must be safely stored away from your SQRL app (such as printing it as a QR code). This will allow you to cancel and replace your SQRL ID in the event that someone was to get a hold of your master SQRL ID.
  
  <image: QR = site + challenge>
  When you visit a SQRL enabled website the QR code/link contains the website and a random cryptographic challenge number.
  
  <image: SQRL ID + website = Website ID>
  Using the website address and your SQRL ID it hashes them together to create a website unique identity. This identity will keep your SQRL ID safe and totally unique for each website you use SQRL with.
  
  <image: Site ID to Public/Private Keys>
  This identity is used to create a website specific public/private key pair. (More info: <link: http://www.youdzone.com/signature.html text:What is a Digital Signature?>)
  
  <image: challenge digitally signed, includes public key>
  The random cryptographic challenge is digitally signed using your Website Private Key and sent back with your Website Public Key. The website is then able to confirm that the user who produced the signature used the private key corresponding to the public key.

  The app also offers the website some puzzle pieces based on your Identity Lock key for the purpose of being able to change your SQRL ID. See <link: #idlock text: Identity Lock> below for more details.

  Once the signed random cryptographic challenge is verified the website is then able to authenticate your device. The website is able to do this by keeping track of the random cryptographic challenges it sends out.


Identity Lock: 101

  <image: >  
  SQRL Identity Lock uses something called Diffie-Hellman (DH) Key Agreement (KA) or DHKA for short. It basically allows 2 sets of public/private keys to create a shared secret; it uses the private key of one with the public key of the other and vice versa.
  
  <image: >
  We have 1 set of Identity Lock/Unlock Keys already, this was generated when we created the SQRL ID. The 2nd set of public/private keys are randomly generated each time.
  
  <image: >  
  DHKA will generate a shared secret using the Identity Lock (public) Key and the Random Private Key. Using the Random Public Key and the Identity Unlock (private) Key will also generate the same shared secret. Magic (or crazy math)!

  <image: >  
  The website is sent the shared secret from using the Identity Lock Key and the Random Private Key as well as the Random Public Key. This protects the Identity Lock Key from being used to identify you between sites.

  <image: >  
  Now we have a puzzle for the SQRL app that only your Identity Unlock Key can solve: You need the Random Public Key from the website and the Identity Unlock Key you have safely stored away to generate the same secret the website has saved.


Identity Lock: Replacing your SQRL ID 
  
  <image: >  
  From your super secret hiding place guarded by laser wielding ninjas, you will retrieve your Identity Unlock Key and import it into your SQRL app.

  <image: >  
  When you wish to replace your SQRL ID the website will send the SQRL app the Random Public Key it has stored and another random cryptographic challenge (same idea as previous).

  <image: >  
  Using the Random Public Key that was retrieved from the website and the imported Identity Unlock Key you will create the same shared secret that the website has stored.

  <image: >  
  The shared secret is hashed with the random cryptographic challenge, this is digitally signed using the old and new Website Private Key and sent back with the old and new Website Public Key.

  <image: >  
  The website can use it's copy of the shared secret to verify the results of the hash sent back to it. Once the hash and old signature are verified the website is able to replace the Website Public Key for the new SQRL ID.


Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

  <image: computer displaying welcome new user>  
  Can I use this to sign up to a website?
    Of course! Depending on the website it may ask your for more information like a traditional sign up process or could allow you stay anonymous.

  <image: phone with pin number> 
  What if someone steals my phone?
    Generally you will use a master password to unlock your SQRL app. It is the user's responsibility to secure the app with a strong password. Some apps could potentially offer alternative ways to secure access in the event of a stolen phone.
    In the rare and unlikely event the password securing the app is compromised (stolen phone), the SQRL protocol will allow a method of revoking your old identity and allowing you to establish a new identity with websites.

  <image: login vs QR> 
  What is the benefit over traditional usernames & passwords?
    There are no usernames or passwords to have compromised, lost or stolen.
    No keyboard interaction, great for using public computers that could log your keystrokes.
    You only need your SQRL ID, no lists of usernames and passwords to keep track of.
    There is NO WAY to link one person across sites based only on the generated website ID, websites may ask for more infomation that could be tracked.


Apps

  SQRL is still being worked out, when some apps are available they will be added here!
